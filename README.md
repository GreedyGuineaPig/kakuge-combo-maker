# kakuge-combo-maker
## I thought it would be nice if we can visualize combo command list on fighting games. So I tried to implemented it with Vue3. But I knew it is much easier to write it as text than accessing an webpage then press appropriate buttons.
## I wouldn't delete this repository but I have no will to push this ridiculous idea forward anymore.
